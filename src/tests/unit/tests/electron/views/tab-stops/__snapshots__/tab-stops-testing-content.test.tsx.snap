    <li>
      Navigate to the screen you want to test in your app.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn on the Show tab stops toggle. An empty circle will highlight the element with focus.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are connected to an emulator, select your emulator app to bring it into focus and use your keyboard.
    </li>
    <li>
      Or If you are connected to a physical mobile device use the keyboard key-buttons below.
    </li>
    <li>
      Move input focus through all the interactive elements in the page:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use Tab and Shift+Tab to navigate between standalone controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the arrow keys to navigate between the focusable elements within a composite control.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      As you navigate to each element, look for these accessibility problems:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An interactive element can't be reached using the Tab and arrow keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          An interactive element "traps" input focus and prevents navigating away.
        </li>
        <li>
          An interactive element doesn't give a visible indication when it has input focus.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tab order is inconsistent with the logical order that's communicated visually.
        </li>
        <li>
          Input focus moves unexpectedly without the user initiating it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
